The handout contained exactly one thing: instructions \nfor punctuating dialogue.\nI’ve been expanding and updating the handout ever since.\nThe purpose of that chapter is to provide, in one place and without going \non too long, some of the most common technical issues that students will face \nas fiction writers.

The chapter introduction explains exactly why it’s critical for \nthem to master these technical points: “One of the writer’s most important \njobs is to gain the reader’s trust.

Losing it is \neasy — and one of the easiest ways to lose a reader’s trust is by paying too little \nattention to mechanics.”\nThis review of the mechanics of fiction has proven to be very useful to my \nstudents over the years. They can refer to it as they write and revise, and I can \nexpect them to know and use these important tools of the craft.\nWe placed this chapter in its own section, knowing that different instruc-\ntors will want to assign it at different points in the term.

The decision to include only con-\ntemporary fiction in the anthology is in no way meant to challenge the impor-\ntance to a writer’s apprenticeship of reading older works. Many of the chapters \ndo, in fact, bring in excerpts from such writers as Poe, Chekhov, Fitzgerald, \nWelty, and others. But an equally important part of the fiction writer’s appren-\nticeship is becoming familiar with contemporary writing and developing a \nsense of what it looks and feels like.\nMost of the examples in this book draw from the anthologized stories. \nMany of the stories are discussed in more than one chapter.

It moves the story forward, or reveals character. It \nnever does nothing. In real life, people say things all the time that don’t mean \nmuch. They dial up friends to kill time. In fiction, however, dialogue should \nnever be killing time. That’s because fiction is a concentrated, highly focused \nversion of reality, and dialogue a concentrated form of speech. If your charac-\nter does digress, the digression should mean something in the context of your \nstory.

Although there ­were \nelements of tragedy and struggle in the Fifth Symphony, he had read, it was \nprincipally music of love and happiness.\nHe heard the toilet flush. “By the way,” Twinkle hollered, “if you want to \nimpress people, I ­wouldn’t play this music. It’s putting me to sleep.”\nSanjeev went to the bathroom to throw away the ashes.

It was even worse than he remembered, \nand all of it executed with the utmost gravity. The artist had a few tricks up his \nsleeve and used them again and again — ­a certain rosy blush on the underside \nof the clouds, a coy backward glance on the faces of the cupids and fauns. The \nceiling was crowded with various dramas, but the one that caught Anders’ eye \nwas Zeus and Europa — ­portrayed, in this rendition, as a bull ogling a cow from \nbehind a haystack. To make the cow sexy, the paint­er had canted her hips sug-\ngestively and given her long, droopy eyelashes through which she gazed back \nat the bull with sultry welcome. The bull wore a smirk and his eyebrows ­were \narched.
