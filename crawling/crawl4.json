Everyone decided to stay, and the first semester at Gotham\nWriters' Workshop had begun.\nThose original students spread the word. So we offered more classes.\nWord of mouth traveled wider.

Today we employ over a hundred instructors who teach more\nthan six thousand students a year.\nDespite our growth, we still think of ourselves as a grassroots organi-\nzation. Class size remains small enough to fit into a New York living room.\nOur teachers continue to bring their passion for writing to every class.

In the broadest sense,\nfiction is simply a made-up story.\nThe business of making up stories has been going on for a long time.\nSomewhere in the shadowy past, our cave-dwelling ancestors began con-\njuring stories and telling them to each other. The tradition grew, and\nsome of these stories eventually attained the \"best-seller\" status of myths,\ntales destined to be passed on through generations and to migrate across\ncontinents and to shape the way people thought.

At some point, some of these\nstories started to get written down with the intention that they would be\nread. An enterprising Mesopotamian writer chiseled The Epic of Gilgamesh\ninto stone tablets some four thousand years ago, and if you think revision\nwas difficult on a typewriter . . .\nAnyway, this brings us to the more narrow definition of fiction: a\nmade-up story told in prose with words alone.\nWords alone.\nThat's the unique challenge and wonder of written fiction. There's no\nactor or storyteller using gesture and inflection. No painter or filmmaker\nshowing settings or close-ups. Everything is done with those little symbols we\ncall letters, which are melded into words, which multiply to form sentences\nand paragraphs.

We seem to have\na primal need for fiction, or really any kind of story, that is as deeply\nrooted as our need for food, shelter, and companionship. I see two reasons\nfor this.\nThe first reason: entertainment. We crave entertainment, and stories\nare one of the key ways we satisfy this desire. The second reason: meaning.\nOur curiosity, and perhaps insecurity, compels us to explore continually the\nwho, what, where, when, and why of our existence.

All fiction ultimately\nrequires is words interacting with the reader's imagination, a combination\nthat provides, for many people, the most powerful form of storytelling\npossible, not to mention the most portable.\nA MATTER OF FORM\nWe'll come back to entertainment and meaning shortly, but now let's take a\nbrief look at the basic forms of fiction.\nFirst, the novel. Typically a novel runs at least eighty thousand words\n(about 320 pages of double-spaced typing). Some novels run a bit shorter\nthan this and many run way longer.

Novels are usually broken into chapters,\nwhich give the reader a much-needed mental break.\nA novel is the literary equivalent of a symphony, the big, ambitious form\nof fiction. Novels aren't just longer than other forms of fiction. They generally\nhave more of everything: more characters, more scenes, more developments,\nmore heft. They may have a central story, but the story is usually surrounded\nby a whole swirling world of activity. Someone once told me she could tell\nif a work was a novel or short story simply by hearing the first sentence.\nInterpret that as you may.\nSome novels are sprawling. Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace is an ocean,\nbearing countless characters over numerous years and thousands of miles,\nimmersing the reader in a span of history, encompassing all aspects of\nhumanity.

Nevertheless, for many an aspiring\nwriter, the novel is the great white whale of fiction, and these people will not\nrest until they have spilled the blood of several hundred pages. Godspeed to\nthem all.\nNext, there's the short story.

Are you still up for seeing a movie?\"\n\"I have to wait to see what Matt is doing.\"\nIn this dialogue, you get a real sense of the characters and the tension\nbetween them. Gina's tone is a little challenging, as if she's used to Dana\nblowing her off. And we see that Dana has an avoidance of making concrete\nplans, due to her reliance on Matt.

The reader is used to dialogue looking\nand performing a certain way. Let's examine some of the conventions of\ndialogue.\nDouble quotation marks signal to the reader that someone is\nspeaking:\nDIALOGUE: TALKING IT UP 133\n\"Dude, you seen my left shoe?\"\n\"Dude, check your right foot.\"\nOccasionally, authors break with convention, foregoing double quotation\nmarks for single ones, dashes, brackets, or even nothing:\n—Dude, you seen my left shoe?\n—Dude, check your right foot.\nBut unless you have a compelling reason to do otherwise, stick with double quotes.\nUsually dialogue dedicates one paragraph per speaker, no matter how\nshort the speech:\nI sidled up to the bars of the drunk tank, resting my forehead on the\ncool steel.

Sometimes writers put different speakers in the same paragraph.\nWhile it's not wrong do to so, it can look confusing or intimidate the\nreader.\nOne of the major conventions of dialogue is the use of tags. In dialogue,\nmost writers add speech tags, also known as attributions, so that the reader\ncan follow who's saying what. Said is the most frequently used tag.

Readers don't even notice that you've used the word\nsaid 507 times. Said becomes invisible:\n\"You gonna drink that?\" she said.\n\"Yes, I am,\" he said.\nYou can use verbs other than said, but you want to make sure they don't\nseem forced or get distracting.\n134 \nWRITING FICTION\n\"You gonna drink that?\" she asked.\n\"Yes, I am,\" he replied.\nHowever, it can be dangerous to veer too far from the sate? paradigm.

You pro-\nclaim emancipation from tyranny, but you say that you had a good\nnight's sleep.\nSimilarly, adverbs in speech tags tend to make the author seem ama-\nteurish. Let what the character is saying tell the reader the tone of voice;\ndon't have your characters speak coquettishly or snidely or sarcastically.\nOccasionally, adverbs are useful, but use them sparingly; they can draw\nattention to themselves in the wrong way, like an eighties hairdo.

The following is jerky and awkward:\n\"I don't,\" she said, \"love you anymore.\"\nWhile this is appropriately devastating:\n\"I don't love you anymore,\" she said.\nBut if the phrase is long, you might want to put the tag in the middle, so\nthat the reader knows who is speaking. Tags in the middle should follow a\nnatural \"breath,\" or break, in the sentence.

I don't believe it would have been\npublished in the first place had I not revised it with theme in mind, and this\nis why I'm here to harp on the topic of theme.\nWHAT IS THEME?\nThe theme is the container for your story. Theme will attempt to hold all\nthe elements of your story in place. It is like a cup. A vessel. A goblet. The\nplot and characters and dialogue and setting and voice and everything else\nare all shaped by the vessel.

And you'll get into an equal amount of trouble if you\nthink of theme as synonymous with message or moral. That kind of thing\nis best left to pundits and philosophers.\nThe novelist John Gardner wisely said: \"By theme here we mean not\na message—a word no good writer likes applied to his work—but the\ngeneral subject, as the theme of an evening of debates may be World\nWide Inflation.\" You see, the theme may be simply world wide inflation\nwithout there being any elegant solution for inflation or even a"

The great Anton Chekhov also said something smart.\nHe said that the fiction writer does not need to solve a problem so much as\nstate the problem correctly.\nSo, you see, you're off the hook. You don't have to create themes that\nwill solve the problems of the world. You just have to shine your flashlight\non some aspect of life and let the reader see what's there. Not every aspect.\nSome aspect. And that's a key point because a theme should give a story\nsome kind of focus, in a manner similar to how plot gives a story focus.\nWe're probably best off by just saying that theme is some kind of\nunifying idea in a story.
